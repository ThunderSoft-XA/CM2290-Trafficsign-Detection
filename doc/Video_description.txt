CM2290 enables AP wifi and runs the compilation to construct the binary executable file generated by this project.  The development board will continuously recognize traffic signs in the images captured by the camera.  After the mobile device is connected to WIFI, the results of traffic sign recognition can be viewed in real time on the mobile device through the rtsp stream.
